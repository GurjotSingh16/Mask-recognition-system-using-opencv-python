# Mask-recognition-system-using-opencv-python
During the COVID-19 pandemic i have made a mask recognition system which specifies that a person is wearing mask or not. If the person is wearing mask then it shows that the person is good to go and can proceed else If the person is not wearinng mask then he is not allowed to proceed without wearing mask.
